DIRECTIONS: (DSITEMS)

  Run the program in the directory where the "SCENARIO.DBS" or "SCENARIO.GLD"
  file is located and it will generate a complete item list, lists of items
  by certain catagories, and a spell reference list.  you might want to
  redirect the output to a file or the printer to make a copy for yourself.

  DOS command example:
    DSITEMS > itemlist.txt


1.1 release notes:
  This now supports the wizardry gold scenario file without having to have
  it renamed.
