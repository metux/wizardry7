attached to your system, or any files on another system attached to your

in plain english:
  If anything happens because of this or any other program packed with it
it is NOT MY FAULT.  you are using them at YOUR OWN RISK!

If I use any language in this file which offends you.  TOUGH!!!

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Now that that is out of the way we can get to the meat of it!


This is the Crusaders of the Dark Savant Savefile editor DSCHEAT v1.1

What you have here represents many hours of searching, sorting, and delving
into the structures of the savefiles.

It is the most complete editor I have ever seen for Crusaders of the Dark
Savant and I hope you like it.  (I happen to have a biased opinion since
I wrote the damn thing!)

I suggest you back up all of your save files before ever using any program
which modifies them on the off chance that some random bit of fuzz in the
air decides to short across some vital portion of your computer causing any
problems or crashes while using any program.  BACK IT UP!!!!!!!!
in specific back up your "SCENARIO.DBS" file before using my program.  I
haven't written any code which would change it, but you never know with
random fuzz!!!


This program was born out of the obsessive need by my girlfriend to be able
to complete any game set in front of her (god bless her!!! she's a game
manufacturer's fantasy).  She got stuck one weekend and started bitching
and fuming about not being able to do anything (she's a little melodramatic
sometimes)  So I said I'd write her an editor for her characters and give
her the ability to go around doors by modifying her position in the save
file.  It turns out I found out a whole lot more about the savefile and
started on what you now have.  She still uses it when she plays the game
even though she's finished it a couple of times.  This program sat around
my computer for about a year and a half so I figured I would finish
the job I started and make it so other people could use it.

I hope you enjoy it.

DIRECTIONS: (DSCHEAT)

  1. Run the program.  That's it!

  You can supply a filename at the command line and when the program starts
  up it will insert that filename into the save file box and then all you will
  have to do is to hit enter.  This is there so that you can set up a batch
  file to help modify any of your game save files.

    example
      DSCHEAT SAVEGAME.DBS

  Pandora's Wand ( Item# 300 ) has so many powers that I could not make it fit
  into the amount of space that I had on a screen so I had to compact it as
  much as possible to make it fit.  The proper line for pandora's wand should
  be:
    PANDORA'S/WAND  3-7 (+1)  Sp:5 (L:4)  ( Dazzling Lights Level 4 )
                              Sleep 15%
                              Paralyze 15%
                              Poison 15%
                              Stone 3%
                              Drain 10%
                              KIA 1%


  While actually playing the game I found that all of the statistics can go to
  19 and not ever have a chance of crashing the game (that I know about!).  I
  seem to recall that I have even had a 20 karma at one time or another. You can
  actually have higher values that will work (and not crash DS) but I chose not
  to restrict the user's ability to enter in values.  I have tested values up to
  about 22 and they appear to work okay.  There was no marked improvement from
  20+ values so I assume DS's internal "tables" of information stop at 19.
  When I wrote the "Max characters" routine I chose very "Safe" values all the
  way across the board that way there wouldn't be any problems if the typical
  user decided to go in max their characters and then go back to the game.  You
  can have up to 32767 spell points, 32767 hit points, and 32767 stamina.  The
  game will almost always crash if the number ever goes higher than those values
  ( like when you go up a level and it adds hit points, spellpts, etc).  If
  those values are set at something like 32000 it normally works just fine.  I
  don't know how DS will react with some of the game patches that are available
  since they might have modified the program somewhat from the version that I
  have.  As always be careful with what you tamper with.

  WORDS OF WISDOM:
    Your skills values should NEVER go above 100.  This normally crashes the
    game when you go up a level, although sometimes DS will keep going and do
    wierd things later on.  For instance I've had it "forget" to repaint the
    screen and then I had all of these little tracers and ghosts ( pieces of
    pictures ) sitting on the screen.


CHARACTER NAMES:
  If you have a game save file which has less than 6 characters in it DSCHEAT
  will ask you when it encounters something that it thinks isn't a valid
  character name.  At which point you can tell the program if it is a good
  name.  If you tell DSCHEAT that an invalid character name is actually a
  valid one   and then change some of the values then there is a strong
  possiblity that you have really screwed up your save file.  So the moral
  here is: DON'T!!
  if on the odd chance an invalid name slips past the invalid name detector
  DON'T MODIFY IT.  Leave it alone.  Also Don't MAX out your characters, in
  this case do each one individually.  If this happens I would like to get
  some e-mail about it so maybe I can figure out what it was that happened.


CHANGE POSITION OPTION:
  DSCheat allows you to modify your party's position in the game.  A few of
  the more common places are listed along with their corresponding values
  so you don't have to remember them.


ITEM EDITING:
  DSCheat allows you to edit the items that are being held by any of your
  characters.  In order to do this correctly DSCheat must have access to
  the "SCENARIO.DBS" file from the Crusaders of the Dark Savant game
  directory.  If this file is not accessible DSCheat will inform you of this
  fact and ask if you wish to continue.  If you choose to continue then
  when you go in to change the character's items you will have to drop
  the item that you changed onto the ground and then pick it back up so that
  Dark Savant's internal values can be reset to what the item should be.
  If you do not do this then there is a strong possibility that the game
  might crash.  Also there are a couple of unknown items which are in the
  middle of the valid items and if you choose them, there is also the
  possibility that the game will crash if your character has them.  All of
  the invalid items have the name '-?-'.   So be careful.


SAFE EDITING OPTION:
  When the "Safe Editing" option is turned on DSCheat will not let you
  enter in any values which are known to crash Dark Savant.  It defaults to
  on so that people who don't want to mess around can just go straight to
  editing.


SAVE/LOAD PLAYER OPTIONS:
  These options are for people who really want to play around with their
  save files and rearrange their characters outside of DS, Copy characters
  from one file to another or just plain look at the character information
  using a hex editor or the like.  The options are not documented very well,
  you have to remember the filenames you use, and I don't intend to make
  any changes to these unless there is some real problem.  They are for the
  "hackers" out there.


(** NEW FOR VERSION 1.1 **)

COMMANDLINE OPTIONS:
  You can now call DSCheat from the command line to do most of the common
  operations that you might want to do everytime you go into Dark Savant.
  Such as Healing all characters, removing all ailments, etc.

  Type "DSCheat /?" for more information on this.

  Insert a line into the batch file that starts up Dark Savant to do this
  automatically!

I would like to thank D.W. Bradley and Sir-Tech software for making a really
good game.  Great puzzles, good graphics, sound is a little annoying at
times but it's good nonetheless.  All around good!!!!!
Can't wait to see the new "Super VGA version!!!"
