WIZWARDRY 7: CRUSADERS OF THE DARK SAVANT - for GNU/Linux
-----------------------------------------------------------

This is a debian-packaged version of the ancient DOS game
"Wizardry7: crusaders of the dark savant", running in dosbox.

To my knowledge, it is abandonware since aeons, so there shouldn't
be any license problems.

If you're the copyright holder and don't like the game to be
distributed that way, please contact me ... I'd also like to
discuss a modern remake ...
